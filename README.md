# Atm-security

# Problem Statement : 
     Provide a safer environment for the user for atm transactions and reduce the possibility of potential pin theft.

# Deep-Learning model and Dataset : 
     Transfer learning on a CNN based model was used for this project.
     No dataset which could be used for hand gesture digit recognition could be found online (ones available 
     at kaggle and github were not suitable for us to use because of various reason).
     So for the purpose of this project, Dataset for this project was collected form scratch.
